Summary of Changes

Replace direct tel: links for the “Call Now” button with a modal popup that shows the phone number and copy-to-clipboard option.

Make WhatsApp Consultation the primary visible CTA on desktop for reliable communication.

2. Mobile Sticky CTA Bar

Ensure the sticky bar with Call Advocate and WhatsApp buttons remains visible and accessible on scroll.

Buttons must have a minimum height of 56px for optimal finger tapping.

Add subtle shadow and contrasting background to distinguish the sticky bar.

Add a clear, SEO-friendly headline describing key legal services and location, e.g.:
“Expert Legal Counsel – Civil, Criminal & Tribunal Representation in Chennai.”

4. Technical Fixes

Fix the broken mobile hero image by verifying correct file path and updating Next.js <Image> component sizing and attributes.

Compress and preload images to improve page load speed and reduce layout shifts.

5. SEO Improvements

Add unique, keyword-rich meta titles and descriptions to the homepage and internal pages.

Implement structured data schemas including LocalBusiness, LegalService, and Review (for future testimonials).
